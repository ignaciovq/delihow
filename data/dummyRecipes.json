Agrega aceite extra si la sartén parece estar seca.\r\nEn la misma sartén, agrega otra cucharada de aceite y cocina las chalotas durante 4-5 minutos, luego agrega el ajo y fríe durante 30 segundos. Agrega el tocino y fríe hasta que esté ligeramente dorado. Traslada la mezcla de cebolla y tocino al recipiente para horno y agrega las hierbas.\r\nPrecalienta el horno a 180C/350F/Gas 4.\r\nVierte la cerveza negra en la sartén y lleva a ebullición, revolviendo para levantar cualquier trozo dorado pegado en el fondo de la sartén. Vierte la cerveza negra sobre la carne en el recipiente para horno y agrega el caldo. Cubre el recipiente y colócalo en el horno durante 1½-2 horas, o hasta que la carne esté tierna y la salsa se haya reducido.\r\nElimina cualquier grasa de la superficie, prueba y agrega sal y pimienta si es necesario, luego agrega la pasta de maicena. Coloca el recipiente para horno en la cocina - no olvides que estará caliente - y cocina a fuego lento durante 1-2 minutos, revolviendo, hasta que espese. Deja enfriar.\r\nAumenta la temperatura del horno a 200C/400F/Gas 6. Para hacer la masa, coloca la harina y la sal en un bol muy grande. Ralla la mantequilla y agrégala a la harina en tres tandas. Agrega gradualmente 325 ml/11 onzas de agua fría - es posible que no necesites todo - y mezcla con un cuchillo redondo hasta que la mezcla se una. Amasa la masa ligeramente en una bola sobre una superficie ligeramente enharinada y reserva 250 g/9 onzas para la tapa del pastel.\r\nExtiende el resto de la masa hasta aproximadamente 2 cm/¾ pulgadas más grande que el recipiente que estás usando. Forra el recipiente con la masa y agrega el relleno, colocando también las ostras. Pinta el borde de la masa con huevo batido.\r\nExtiende el resto de la masa hasta que sea ligeramente más grande que tu recipiente y colócala suavemente sobre el relleno, presionando los bordes firmemente para sellar, luego recorta con un cuchillo afilado. Pinta con huevo batido para dar brillo. Coloca el recipiente en una bandeja para hornear y hornea durante 25-30 minutos, o hasta que la masa esté dorada y el relleno esté burbujeando.",

    "steps": "Season the beef cubes with salt and black pepper. Heat a tablespoon of oil in the frying pan and fry the meat over a high heat. Do this in three batches so that you don’t overcrowd the pan, transferring the meat to a large flameproof casserole dish once it is browned all over. Add extra oil if the pan seems dry.\r\nIn the same pan, add another tablespoon of oil and cook the shallots for 4-5 minutes, then add the garlic and fry for 30 seconds. Add the bacon and fry until slightly browned. Transfer the onion and bacon mixture to the casserole dish and add the herbs.\r\nPreheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.\r\nPour the stout into the frying pan and bring to the boil, stirring to lift any stuck-on browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Pour the stout over the beef in the casserole dish and add the stock. Cover the casserole and place it in the oven for 1½-2 hours, or until the beef is tender and the sauce is reduced.\r\nSkim off any surface fat, taste and add salt and pepper if necessary, then stir in the cornflour paste. Put the casserole dish on the hob – don’t forget that it will be hot – and simmer for 1-2 minutes, stirring, until thickened. Leave to cool.\r\nIncrease the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6. To make the pastry, put the flour and salt in a very large bowl. Grate the butter and stir it into the flour in three batches. Gradually add 325ml/11fl oz cold water – you may not need it all – and stir with a round-bladed knife until the mixture just comes together. Knead the pastry lightly into a ball on a lightly floured surface and set aside 250g/9oz for the pie lid.\r\nRoll the rest of the pastry out until about 2cm/¾in larger than the dish you’re using. Line the dish with the pastry then pile in the filling, tucking the oysters in as well. Brush the edge of the pastry with beaten egg.\r\nRoll the remaining pastry until slightly larger than your dish and gently lift over the filling, pressing the edges firmly to seal, then trim with a sharp knife. Brush with beaten egg to glaze. Put the dish on a baking tray and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden-brown and the filling is bubbling.",

      "350 g de chalotas",

      "2 hojas de laurel",

    ],
    "steps": "Caliente una cacerola grande y agregue 1 cucharada de grasa de ganso. Sazone la carne y fría hasta que esté dorada, unos 3-5 minutos, luego déle vuelta y fría el otro lado hasta que la carne esté dorada por todos lados, agregando más grasa si es necesario. Haga esto en 2-3 tandas, transfiriendo la carne a un colador colocado sobre un recipiente cuando esté dorada. En la misma cacerola, fría el tocino, las chalotas o las cebollitas perladas, los champiñones, el ajo y el bouquet garni hasta que estén ligeramente dorados. Mezcle la pasta de tomate y cocine por unos minutos, revolviendo en la mezcla. Esto enriquece el bourguignon y hace una excelente base para el guiso. Luego, vuelva a poner la carne y cualquier jugo drenado en la cacerola y revuelva. Vierta el vino y aproximadamente 100 ml de agua para que la carne flote en el líquido, pero no esté completamente cubierta. Lleve a ebullición y use una cuchara para raspar los jugos de cocción caramelizados del fondo de la cacerola; esto le dará más sabor al guiso. Precaliente el horno a 150°C/con ventilador 130°C/gas 2. Haga un cartucho: rasgue un cuadrado de papel aluminio ligeramente más grande que la cacerola, colóquelo en la cacerola para que cubra la parte superior del guiso y recorte cualquier exceso de papel. Luego, cocine durante 3 horas. Si la salsa parece acuosa, retire la carne y las verduras con una cuchara ranurada y reserve. Cocine la salsa a fuego alto durante unos minutos hasta que se espese un poco, luego vuelva a poner la carne y las verduras en la cacerola. Para hacer el puré de apio-rábano, pele el apio-rábano y córtelo en cubos. Caliente el aceite de oliva en una sartén grande. Agregue el apio-rábano y fría durante 5 minutos hasta que esté dorado. Sazone bien con sal y pimienta. Agregue el romero, el tomillo, la hoja de laurel y las vainas de cardamomo y luego vierta 200 ml de agua, suficiente para cubrir casi por completo el apio-rábano. Baje el fuego, cubra parcialmente la sartén y deje que hierva a fuego lento durante 25-30 minutos. Después de 25-30 minutos, el apio-rábano debería estar suave y la mayor parte del agua se habrá evaporado. Escurra cualquier agua restante, luego retire las ramitas de hierbas, la hoja de laurel y las vainas de cardamomo. Triture ligeramente con un pasapurés, luego termine con un chorro de aceite de oliva y sazone al gusto. Sirva el bourguignon de ternera en cuencos y coloque una gran cucharada de puré de apio-rábano encima. Adorne con una de las hojas de laurel, si lo desea.",

    "steps": "1 Preparar el brisket para cocinar: En un lado del brisket debe haber una capa de grasa, la cual se desea. Si hay trozos grandes de grasa, córtelos y deséchelos. Los grandes trozos de grasa no podrán derretirse completamente.\r\nCon un cuchillo afilado, haga cortes en la grasa en líneas paralelas, separadas aproximadamente 3/4 de pulgada. Corte la grasa, no la carne. Repita en la dirección opuesta para hacer un patrón de cruz.\r\nSalpimente bien el brisket y déjelo reposar a temperatura ambiente durante 30 minutos.\r\n \r\n2 Dorar el brisket: Necesitará una olla con fondo grueso que se pueda usar en el horno y tenga una tapa, o una cacerola holandesa, que sea lo suficientemente ancha como para contener el asado de brisket con un poco de espacio para las cebollas.\r\nSeque el brisket y colóquelo, con la parte grasa hacia abajo, en la olla y colóquelo a fuego medio-alto. Cocine durante 5-8 minutos, hasta que la parte grasa esté bien dorada. (Si el asado parece estar cocinándose demasiado rápido, baje el fuego a medio. Desea un chisporroteo constante, no un salteado furioso.)\r\nDale la vuelta al brisket y cocine por unos minutos más para dorar el otro lado.\r\n\r\n3 Sofreír las cebollas y el ajo: Cuando el brisket esté dorado, retire de la olla y reserve. Debería haber un par de cucharadas de grasa derretida en la olla, si no, agregue un poco de aceite de oliva.\r\nAgregue las cebollas picadas y aumente el fuego a alto. Espolvoree un poco de sal sobre las cebollas. Sofría, revolviendo con frecuencia, hasta que las cebollas estén ligeramente doradas, de 5 a 8 minutos. Agregue el ajo y cocine por 1-2 minutos más.\r\n \r\n4 Volver el brisket a la olla, agregar hierbas, caldo, llevar a ebullición, cubrir, cocinar en el horno: Precalentar el horno a 300°F. Use hilo de cocina para atar las hojas de laurel, el romero y el tomillo.\r\nMueva las cebollas y el ajo a los lados de la olla y acomode el brisket adentro. Agregue el caldo de carne y las hierbas atadas. Lleve el caldo a ebullición en la estufa.\r\nCubra la olla, colóquela en el horno a 300°F y cocine durante 3 horas. Voltee cuidadosamente el brisket cada hora para que se cocine de manera uniforme.\r\n \r\n5 Agregue las zanahorias y continúe cocinando: Después de 3 horas, agregue las zanahorias. Cubre la olla y cocina por 1 hora más. En los últimos 20 minutos de cocción, agrega las papas y las zanahorias.",

(You don't want to cook it at this stage, just colour it). Remove the beef from the pan and leave to cool, then brush all over with the mustard.\r\nLay a sheet of cling film on a work surface and arrange the Parma ham slices on it, in slightly overlapping rows. With a palette knife, spread the mushroom paste over the ham, then place the seared beef fillet in the middle. Keeping a tight hold of the cling film from the edge, neatly roll the Parma ham and mushrooms around the beef to form a tight barrel shape. Twist the ends of the cling film to secure. Chill for 15-20 mins to allow the beef to set and keep its shape.\r\nRoll out the puff pastry on a floured surface to a large rectangle, the thickness of a £1 coin. Remove the cling film from the beef, then lay in the centre. Brush the surrounding pastry with egg yolk. Fold the ends over, the wrap the pastry around the beef, cutting off any excess. Turn over, so the seam is underneath, and place on a baking sheet. Brush over all the pastry with egg and chill for about 15 mins to let the pastry rest.\r\nHeat the oven to 200C, 400F, gas 6.\r\nLightly score the pastry at 1cm intervals and glaze again with beaten egg yolk. Bake for 20 minutes, then lower the oven setting to 180C, 350F, gas 4 and cook for another 15 mins. Allow to rest for 10-15 mins before slicing and serving with the side dishes of your choice.

    "steps": "Make the Pastry Dough\r\n\r\nTo a large bowl, add flour, 1 teaspoon salt, and turmeric and mix thoroughly.\r\nRub shortening into flour until there are small pieces of shortening completely covered with flour.\r\nPour in 1/2 cup of the ice water and mix with your hands to bring the dough together. Keep adding ice water 2 to 3 tablespoons at a time until the mixture forms a dough.\r\nAt this stage, you can cut the dough into 2 large pieces, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 30 minutes before using it.\r\nAlternatively, cut the dough into 10 to 12 equal pieces, place on a platter or baking sheet, cover securely with plastic wrap and let chill for 30 minutes while you make the filling.\r\nMake the Filling\r\n\r\nAdd ground beef to a large bowl. Sprinkle in allspice and black pepper. Mix together and set aside.\r\nHeat oil in a skillet until hot.\r\nAdd onions and sauté until translucent. Add hot pepper, garlic and thyme and continue to sauté for another minute. Add 1/4 teaspoon salt.\r\nAdd seasoned ground beef and toss to mix, breaking up any clumps, and let cook until the meat is no longer pink.\r\nAdd ketchup and more salt to taste.\r\nPour in 2 cups of water and stir. Bring the mixture to a boil then reduce heat and let simmer until most of the liquid has evaporated and whatever is remaining has reduced to a thick sauce.\r\nFold in green onions. Remove from heat and let cool completely.\r\nAssemble the Patties\r\n\r\nBeat the egg and water together to make an egg wash. Set aside.\r\nNow you can prepare the dough in two ways.\r\nFirst Method: Flour the work surface and rolling pin. If you had cut it into 2 large pieces, then take one of the large pieces and roll it out into a very large circle. Take a bowl with a wide rim (about 5 inches) and cut out three circles.\r\n\r\nPlace about 3 heaping tablespoons of the filling onto 1/2 of each circle. Dip a finger into the water and moisten the edges of the pastry. Fold over the other half and press to seal. \r\n\r\nTake a fork and crimp the edges. Cut off any extra to make it look neat and uniform. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and continue to work until you have rolled all the dough and filled the patties.\r\nSecond Method: If you had pre-cut the dough into individual pieces, work with one piece of dough at a time. Roll it out on a floured surface into a 5-inch circle or a little larger. Don’t worry if the edges are not perfect.\r\n\r\nPlace 3 heaping tablespoons of the filling on one side of the circle. Dip a finger into the water and moisten the edges of the pastry. Fold over the other half and press to seal.\r\n\r\nTake a fork and crimp the edges. Cut off any extra to make it look neat and uniform. Place on a parchment-lined baking sheet and continue work until you have rolled all the dough and filled the patties.\r\n\r\nFrying and Serving the Patties\r\n\r\nAfter forming the patties, place the pans in the refrigerator while you heat the oven to 350 F.\r\nJust before adding the pans with the patties to the oven, brush the patties with egg wash.\r\nBake patties for 30 minutes or until golden brown.\r\nCool on wire racks.\r\nServe warm.",

    "steps": "Wash and rinse the dried kidney beans.. then cover with water in a deep bowl. Remember as they soak they will expand to at least triple the size they were originally so add a lot of water to the bowl. Soak them overnight or for at least 2 hrs to make the cooking step go quicker. I tossed out the water they were soaked in after it did the job.\r\n\r\nHave your butcher cut the salted pigtail into 2 inch pieces as it will be very difficult to cut with an ordinary kitchen knife. Wash, then place a deep pot with water and bring to a boil. Cook for 20 minutes, then drain + rinse and repeat (boil again in water). The goal is to make the pieces of pig tails tender and to remove most of the salt it was cured in.\r\n\r\nTime to start the soup. Place everything in the pot (except the flour and potato), then cover with water and place on a high flame to bring to a boil. As it comes to a boil, skim off any scum/froth at the top and discard. Reduce the heat to a gentle boil and allow it to cook for 1 hr and 15 mins.. basically until the beans are tender and start falling apart.\r\n\r\nIt’s now time to add the potato (and Yams etc if you’re adding it) as well as the coconut milk and continue cooking for 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nNow is a good time to start making the basic dough for the spinner dumplings. Mix the flour and water (add a pinch of salt if you want) until you have a soft/smooth dough. allow it to rest for 5 minutes, then pinch of a tablespoon at a time and roll between your hands to form a cigarette shape.\r\n\r\nAdd them to the pot, stir well and continue cooking for another 15 minutes on a rolling boil.\r\n\r\nYou’ll notice that I didn’t add any salt to the pot as the remaining salt from the salted pigtails will be enough to properly season this dish. However you can taste and adjust accordingly. Lets recap the timing part of things so you’re not confused. Cook the base of the soup for 1 hr and 15 minute or until tender, then add the potatoes and cook for 15 minutes, then add the dumplings and cook for a further 15 minutes. Keep in mind that this soup will thicken quite a bit as it cools.\r\n\r\nWhile this is not a traditional recipe to any one specific island, versions of this soup (sometimes called stewed peas) can be found throughout the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa. A hearty bowl of this soup will surely give you the sleepies (some may call it ethnic fatigue). You can certainly freeze the leftovers and heat it up another day.",

Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens; finely chop whites. Peel and finely chop garlic.\r\n\r\n2. In a medium bowl, soak bread with 2 TBSP water (4 TBSP for 4 servings); break up with your hands until pasty. Stir in beef, sriracha, scallion whites, half the garlic, salt (we used 3/4 tsp kosher salt; 11/2 tsp for 4), and pepper. Form into two 1-inch-tall loaves (four loaves for 4). Place on one side of a baking sheet. Toss carrots on empty side of same sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. (For 4, spread meatloaves out across whole sheet and add carrots to a second sheet.) Bake for 20 minutes (we'll glaze the meatloaves then).\r\n\r\n3. Meanwhile, place potatoes in a medium pot with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil and cook until very\r\ntender, 12-15 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup potato cooking liquid, then drain. While potatoes cook, in a small bowl, combine soy sauce, garlic powder, 1/4 cup ketchup (1/2 cup for 4 servings), and 2 tsp sugar (4 tsp for 4).\r\n\r\n4. Once meatloaves and carrots have baked 20 minutes, remove from oven. Spoon half the ketchup glaze over meatloaves (save\r\nthe rest for serving); return to oven until carrots are browned and tender, meatloaves are cooked through, and glaze is tacky, 4-5 minutes more.\r\n\r\n5. Meanwhile, melt 2 TBSP butter (4 TBSP for 4 servings) in pot used for potatoes over medium heat. Add remaining garlic and cook\r\nuntil fragrant, 30 seconds. Add potatoes and 1/4 tsp wasabi. Mash, adding splashes of reserved potato cooking liquid as necessary until smooth. Season with salt and pepper. (If you like things spicy, stir in more wasabi!)\r\n\r\n6. Divide meatloaves, mashed potatoes, and roasted carrots between plates. Sprinkle with scallion greens and serve with remaining ketchup glaze on the side for dipping.",
